# Virtual Pet

Virtual pet is a game about keeping your pet happy and healthy.  I wrote this game while going through a Udemy course about Phaser.io.

I am interested in game development for two reasons:

1. application of aritificial intelligence and
2. using games as engaging media for education

I also find game development interesting due to the challenges of state management, reactive programming, and real-time processing that are required in games.  

You can play the game [here](https://tahahojati.github.io/virtual_pet_game/ "Virtual Pet Game - Live!"). Or you can clone this project on your computer and then fire it up using either Node's http-server or Python's http.server.
